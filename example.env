# This environment variable is not required. Default value is `$$host` which resolves site by host.
# For example, if your host is `example.com`, site's name should be `example.com`,
# or if host is `127.0.0.1` (local debugging), it should be `127.0.0.1` This variable allows
# to override described behavior. Let's say you create site named `mysite`
# and do want to access it by `127.0.0.1` host. Than you would set this variable to `mysite`.
